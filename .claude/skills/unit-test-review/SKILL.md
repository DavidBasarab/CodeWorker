description: Verify the correct unit tests exist for changed production code, per the TDD rules in .claude/rules/csharp/testing.md. Use when the user says "review the tests", "unit test review", "verify test coverage", "are the right tests written", or as the test gate in a phase's Definition of Done. Pairs every changed production class with its <Class>Tests test class, enumerates the behaviors each changed method must cover, and flags missing tests, tests that cannot fail, and test-stack violations. Only when findings exist does it write a report to .reviews/ (gitignored). Ends with an explicit PASS or FAIL verdict so a review loop can gate on it. This skill NEVER edits source code and NEVER deletes report files.

# Unit Test Review

Validate that the **correct** unit tests exist for the code in scope — not merely that tests pass. `dotnet test` proves the tests are green; this skill proves the tests are the *right* tests. It **only reads and reports** — it does not fix code, does not write tests, and does not delete report files.

## Step 1 — Resolve the scope

Map the user's phrasing to a concrete set of files. Run all `git` commands from the repo root (`C:\Code\CodeWorker`).

| User says | Scope |
|---|---|
| "review the tests" / no scope given (phase gate) | Staged + unstaged + untracked files: `git status --porcelain`. Review the **current working-tree content**. |
| "review the tests for the CodeWorker project" (or CodeWorker.Cli) | All source + test files for that project pair — `CodeWorker` + `CodeWorker.Tests`, `CodeWorker.Cli` + `CodeWorker.Cli.Tests`. |
| "review the tests in the last commit" | Files changed in `HEAD` via `git show --stat --name-only HEAD`; content via `git show HEAD:<path>`. |
| "review the tests in commit `<hash>`" | Same, for `<hash>`. |

Rules:
- Only `*.cs` files matter. Skip `bin/`, `obj/`, generated code, `.csproj`, and config.
- If the resolved scope is empty, say so, declare **PASS (nothing in scope)**, and stop — do not write a report.
- The scope always includes **both sides of the mirror**: when a production file is in scope, its test class is in scope even if unchanged, and vice versa.

## Step 2 — Load the rules

Read `C:\Code\CodeWorker\.claude\rules\csharp\testing.md` and the Testing section of `C:\Code\CodeWorker\.claude\rules\csharp\not-allowed.md`. These are the source of truth — treat them as a checklist, do not rely on memory. Also keep in mind the structure rules from `csharp/naming-and-structure.md` for namespace mirroring.

## Step 3 — Build the pairing map

For every **production** file in scope, locate its test counterpart; for every **test** file in scope, locate its production class.

- `CodeWorker/<path>/<Class>.cs` → `CodeWorker.Tests/<path>/<Class>Tests.cs` — one test class per production class, one-to-one. Same shape for `CodeWorker.Cli` → `CodeWorker.Cli.Tests`.
- Test namespace = production namespace with the `Testing.` prefix, mirroring the folder path exactly: `FatCat.CodeWorker.Commands` → `Testing.FatCat.CodeWorker.Commands`.
- Test classes are plain xUnit classes (no base class) that create the SUT and its fakes in the constructor.

Classify every production class in scope as one of:

1. **Requires tests** — anything with logic: commands (`ICommand` implementations), capability interfaces extending it, `CommandResolver`/`IResolveCommand`, `CodeWorkerApplication`, services, workers, helpers.
2. **Exempt** — only these, and each must be verifiable:
   - Classes marked `[ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` **with a specific `Justification`** naming the low-level API wrapped and confirming no branching logic. If the class contains branching or orchestration, the exemption is invalid — flag it.
   - Autofac `*Module` classes, `GlobalUsings.cs`, `Program`/startup hooks.
   - Pure contract POCOs (`*Data`, `*Settings`, `*Request`, `*Response`, task/config models) with no behavior beyond properties.
   - Logging statements (TDD is not enforced for logging).

An in-scope production class that **requires tests** and has no test class, or a changed public method with no corresponding test, is a **Gap** finding. An orphaned test file whose production class does not exist is also a finding.

## Step 4 — Review through three lenses

### Lens 1 — Coverage: are the right behaviors tested?

For each changed public method on a class that requires tests, enumerate its observable behaviors and check a test exists for **each**:

- Every return path: each guard clause / early return, each enum outcome, each switch arm.
- Every external-process interaction (Claude CLI, git) verified via the faked interface that wraps it — the arguments the process is invoked with, and how its result is handled.
- Every file-system interaction (reading task markdown, writing outputs into tracked repos, reading settings JSON) verified via the faked file-system abstraction.
- Command behavior: the command resolves for its expected trigger and `Execute(args)` performs the expected action — assert the collaborators it drives, not the framework wiring.
- Time-dependent behavior tested through the injected time abstraction; delay/sleep behavior through `FakeThread`.

One test verifies exactly one thing. A single test asserting five behaviors is a finding; so is one behavior with no test.

### Lens 2 — Validity: can each test actually fail?

A test that cannot fail is worse than a missing test — it certifies nothing.

- Every `[Fact]` must contain at least one assertion (`.Should()...`) or verification (`MustHaveHappened`).
- **Tautology check:** flag tests that assert a fake's configured return value equals that same configured value, tests that assert against the very object they constructed as the expectation without the SUT transforming anything, and tests where the assertion cannot be affected by the production code under test.
- Flag tests that hit a real file system, a real external process, real time (`DateTime.UtcNow` outside test-data setup), real threads/delays, or the network. Unit tests are deterministic, pure C#; the interfaces are faked.
- Flag hard-coded test data where `Faker.Create<T>()` is required.

### Lens 3 — Test-stack conformance

- Layout: test class name = source class name + `Tests`, one test class per production class, plain xUnit class (no base class), SUT and fakes created in the test class constructor.
- Naming: verb-first `[Fact]` names (`ReturnOk`, `ExecuteTheCommand`) — no `Should`, no underscores, no Given/When/Then.
- Assertions: FluentAssertions (`.Should()`, `.Be()`, `.BeEquivalentTo()`).
- Fakes: `A.Fake<T>()` / `A.CallTo(...)`; matchers are `A<T>._`, never `A<T>.Ignored`; `ReturnsLazily` for values that vary per test.
- Threading: `FakeThread`, never real delays.
- Test data: `Faker.Create<T>()`, never hard-coded values.
- Block bodies everywhere — the expression-bodied ban applies to test code (methods and constructors).
- One assertion per test.

## Step 5 — Report and verdict

Categorize every finding:

- **Gap** — a behavior, branch, or class with no test. (Blocks the gate.)
- **Defect** — a test that cannot fail, tests real infrastructure, or verifies the wrong thing. (Blocks the gate.)
- **Conformance** — wrong layout, naming, assertion library, fake pattern. (Blocks the gate.)

**If there are no findings:** state **`Unit test review: PASS`** inline with a one-paragraph summary of what was paired and checked. **Do not write a file.**

**If there are findings:** write one markdown report to `.reviews/` and end with **`Unit test review: FAIL — <N> finding(s)`**.

- Filename: `.reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss>-tests-<scope-slug>.md`. Generate the timestamp with `pwsh -Command '. $PROFILE; (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmss")'`.
- The report must be actionable by another session (precise file, class, method, missing behavior, required test) and readable by a human.

### Report template

```markdown
# Unit Test Review — <scope description>

- **Reviewed:** <scope, e.g. "uncommitted changes (5 production files, 3 test files)">
- **Generated:** <timestamp>
- **Verdict:** FAIL — <N> finding(s): <g> gap(s), <d> defect(s), <c> conformance
- **Pairing map:** <one line per production class → its test class or "MISSING">

> Generated by `/unit-test-review`. To resolve, point a session at this file and ask it
> to write the missing tests / fix the listed findings, then re-run `/unit-test-review`.
> **Do not delete this file** — use `/clean-reviews` to remove reports.

## <relative/path/to/Class.cs>

### 1. [Gap] <behavior with no test>
- **Method:** <method name>
- **Behavior:** <the observable outcome that is untested>
- **Rule:** csharp/testing.md, <which rule>
- **Required test:** <concrete test to add — target test class, verb-first name, what it asserts>

### 2. [Defect] <test that cannot fail>
- **Test:** <Tests class>.<FactName> (<file>:<line>)
- **Problem:** <why it certifies nothing>
- **Required change:** <the fix>

---

## Summary checklist
- [ ] <Class> — <one line per finding>
```

## Hard rules for this skill

- **Never edit source or test files.** Review and report only; writing the missing tests is a separate, explicit action by a session pointed at the report.
- **Never delete a report.** Removing reports is exclusively `/clean-reviews`.
- **Do not commit anything.** `.reviews/` is gitignored by design.
- **Never run `dotnet test` as a substitute for this review.** Passing tests are a separate gate; this skill judges whether the *right* tests exist.
- Ground every Gap/Defect/Conformance finding in `.claude/rules/csharp/testing.md` or `not-allowed.md`. Judgment calls that no rule covers go in a clearly separated "Observations (not findings)" section and do not affect the verdict.
- Always end with the explicit verdict line (`Unit test review: PASS` or `Unit test review: FAIL — <N> finding(s)`) so a phase's review loop can gate on it.
